-This script works on the 'Orthogroups' file output of Orthofinder to split each orthogroup in a single fasta file.
-It also gets rid of orthogroups with less sequences than the number specified by the user.
-It also filters (naively) paralogous genes (only one copy is left while the other are removed from groups)
