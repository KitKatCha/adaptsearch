************************  BlastAlign  ************************

This program takes nucleotide sequences in fasta format and returns a multiple alignment (in Nexus & Phylip formats) using BLASTN


Will exclude sequences where gaps make up more than 95% of the sequence in the final alignment

Input file ./locus1_sp2.fasta has 2 sequences and is 360 bytes
(maximum number of sequences that will be used to search for the reference sequence is 1767)


BlastAlign finished: it has produced a multiple alignment of 2 sequences and length 160 by aligning to sequence Am31/11000160 (percentage of gaps in each sequence is less than 95%)
